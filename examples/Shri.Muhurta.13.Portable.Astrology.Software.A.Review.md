## What is a Spore Registration Code Generator?
 
A Spore registration code generator is a software tool that can generate random and valid codes for Spore. These codes can be used to register your game on EA's website and access the online features of Spore, such as the Sporepedia, the online community, and the Galactic Adventures expansion pack. A Spore registration code generator can be useful if you lost your original code, if your code was already used by someone else, or if you want to create multiple accounts for different purposes.
 
## Where can I find a Spore Registration Code Generator?
 
There are many websites that claim to offer a Spore registration code generator for free, but most of them are scams that may infect your computer with malware or steal your personal information. Therefore, you should be very careful when downloading any software from unknown sources. The safest way to get a Spore registration code generator is to use one that is already built into the game files. This method was discovered by some Steam users who had trouble registering their game on EA's website[^1^]. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Make sure you have Spore installed on your computer. If you bought it from Steam, you can find it in your library.
2. Open the Run window by pressing the Windows key and the R key at the same time.
3. Type "regedit" and hit Enter or click OK. A prompt will come up, give administrator privileges.
4. Navigate to HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Electronic Arts\SPORE(TM) (or SPORE\_EP1 or SPORE Creepy & Cute Parts Pack if you have those installed).
5. Open "ergc" under "spore(tm)" (or the other titles listed above if that's the case). Inside this folder is the CD Key.
6. Find the CD key which is titled "ProductKey" under "Data". It should be a 20 character code. To copy paste the code, double click on the name "(Default)" and the code will be automatically selected.
7. Paste the code somewhere safe, such as a text document or a note app.
8. Repeat steps 4-7 for each title that you have installed (SPORE\_EP1 and SPORE Creepy & Cute Parts Pack).
9. You now have three codes that you can use to register your game on EA's website. Each code corresponds to a different title (Spore, Galactic Adventures, and Creepy & Cute Parts Pack).

## How to use a Spore Registration Code Generator?
